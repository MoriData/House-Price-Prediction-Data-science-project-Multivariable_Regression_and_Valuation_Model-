## Project Overview

Welcome to the Boston Housing Price Prediction project! This project focuses on building a multivariable regression model to predict housing prices in Boston during the 1970s. The goal is to estimate the price of residential properties based on various features such as the number of rooms, the distance to employment centers, the socioeconomic status of the area, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Boston Housing dataset, which includes information on various factors influencing housing prices in the Boston area during the 1970s. The key features of the dataset include:

- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status of the population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

Usage
-----

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order. The notebook guides you through data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Results
-------

The model achieved \[mention key metrics like R-squared, RMSE, etc.\]. The results indicate that the model is effective in predicting housing prices with reasonable accuracy. For a detailed analysis, refer to the results section in the notebook.

Conclusion
----------

This project demonstrates the application of multivariable regression to predict housing prices in Boston. The model provides valuable insights into the factors that influence housing prices and can be further improved with more advanced techniques or additional data.
